DSC_E3.5

Suppose that we have a relation marks(ID, score) and we wish to assign grades to students based on the score as follows:
	•	Grade F if score < 40
	•	Grade C if 40 ≤ score < 60
	•	Grade B if 60 ≤ score < 80
	•	Grade A if 80 ≤ score

Write SQL queries to do the following:

a. Display the grade for each student based on the marks relation.

b. Find the number of students with each grade.
